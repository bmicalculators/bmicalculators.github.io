                <div class="card bg-dark mb-4">
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h4>Metric Formula</h4>
                        <p>BMI = weight (kg) / height² (m²)</p>
                        
                        <h4>Imperial Formula</h4>
                        <p>BMI = (weight (lbs) × 703) / height² (inches²)</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Why Gender Matters in BMI</h3>
                <p>BMI interpretation can vary between men and women due to different body compositions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Men typically have more muscle mass</li>
                    <li>Women naturally have higher body fat percentages</li>
                    <li>Body fat distribution patterns differ between genders</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Limitations of BMI</h3>
                <p>While BMI is a useful screening tool, it has some limitations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Doesn't account for muscle mass</li>
                    <li>May not be suitable for athletes</li>
                    <li>Doesn't measure body fat distribution</li>
                    <li>May not be appropriate for elderly individuals</li>
